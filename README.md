## Book Catalog API

This project provides a simple RESTful API for managing a catalog of books, built with Django and Django REST Framework. It includes a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for automated testing and Docker image building, and it's set up for deployment to Kubernetes using Helm.

## Project Overview ðŸ“š

The Book Catalog API allows users to perform standard CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on book records. Each book has the following attributes:

- Title
- Author
- ISBN
- Published date

**Key Features:**

- RESTful Endpoints for CRUD operations  
- Data validation to ensure integrity  
- Health check endpoint for monitoring
