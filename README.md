## Book Catalog API

This project provides a simple RESTful API for managing a catalog of books, built with Django and Django REST Framework. It includes a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for automated testing and Docker image building, and it's set up for deployment to Kubernetes using Helm.

---

## Project Overview ðŸ“š

The Book Catalog API allows users to perform standard CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on book records. Each book has the following attributes:

- Title
- Author
- ISBN
- Published date

**Key Features:**

- RESTful Endpoints for CRUD operations  
- Data validation to ensure integrity  
- Health check endpoint for monitoring  

---

## Local Build and Run Instructions
Clone the repository:
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-repository-directory>

Create and activate Python virtual environment:
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Apply migrations:
python3 manage.py makemigrations api
python3 manage.py migrate

Run the development server:
python3 manage.py runserver 8000
or use another port if needed
python3 manage.py runserver 8001
Access the API at:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/

## CI/CD Pipeline Explanation (GitHub Actions)
Trigger: On push to main or pull requests.

Install Dependencies: Sets up Python and installs requirements.

Run Tests:

Check migrations.

Run tests with pytest.

Docker Build & Push (on main branch):

Build Docker image tagged with commit SHA/version.

Push to container registry (GitHub Container Registry/Docker Hub).

Helm Chart Update (GitOps):

Update values.yaml with new Docker image tag.

Commit and push back to Git repo.

GitOps tool (e.g., ArgoCD) detects change and deploys to Kubernetes.

## Kubernetes and Helm Setup Instructions 
### Helm Chart Location
Located in books-catalog-chart/ directory.

Includes:

Chart.yaml (metadata)

values.yaml (config, updated by CI/CD)

templates/ (K8s manifests)

### Deployment Process (GitOps Flow)
Developer pushes code.

CI/CD builds/tests and pushes Docker image.

CI/CD updates values.yaml with new image tag and commits.

ArgoCD (or similar) detects commit, applies updated Helm chart to Kubernetes.
